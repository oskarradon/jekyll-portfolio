Discursive Impulse is a writing platform published by the Pacific Northwest College of Art (PNCA) MA in Critical Studies program and the Center for Contemporary Art & Culture.

I designed and built the site as a part of my workstudy internship in the PNCA Communications department. The site uses Ghost which was a dream to develop a theme for, as their docs are very well written. My favorite detail in this project is the `a:hover` animation.
