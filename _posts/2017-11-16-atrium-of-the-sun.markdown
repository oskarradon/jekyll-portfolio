Atrium of the Sun is a collaborative project between myself and Lisa Radon. It was a part of the Sensory Gymnastics exhibition at Disjecta in Portland, OR.

It is a static site which I developed using Gulp to automate CSS, JS, and image minification, and to run a development server with BrowserSync.
